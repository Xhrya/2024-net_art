          The works that I have chosen to include in this exhibition are "The
          Thing" by Wolfgang Staehle, "Conversation Map" by Warren Sack, "ART
          DIRT IM-PORT" by G.H. Hovagimyan and guests, and ".ping Project" by
          Umstätter, Antya; Meschkat, Steffen; Schmidt, Axel.
        </p>

        <p>
          All these works engage with the way information is organized online,
          which often manifests in information overload. For example, "The
          Conversation Map" visualizes the usage of the internet—visitors can
          see the relationships between messages and their results and the
          overwhelming amount of lines connecting the different conversations.
        </p>

        <p>
          The ".ping project" digs deeper into the visible structure of the
          network connection. I find it interesting that the interactive map of
          the World Wide Web, as shown through the visual camera in this ".ping"
          computer program, again shows a series of lines that are
          interconnected in a weblike way that’s hard to untangle. The lines
          comprising the web highlights the internet's interactivity and the
          mass amount of data it contains.
        </p>

        <p>
          The other two works in this exhibition invite visitors to reflect on
          how conversations and data are added to and organized on the web. "The
          Thing" furthered the realm of data nets and communications; these
          conversations and strings contributed to the web as seen in the
          ".ping", and "Conversation Map".
        </p>

        <p>
          The final artwork that I decided to include, "ARTDIRT IM-PORT," is an
          ironic representation of the bundled strings seen in the other two
          artworks. The first two pieces in this exhibition showcase an
          overcrowded ball of information, but in this work, visitors see a chat
          window that shows a two-way conversation between port1 and port2.
          Within the confines of their physical spaces, these two are lonely, as
          shown through the various screenshots - covering their bodies with a
          blanket and isolating themselves in front of the computer, or lying on
          the floor with their faces veiled - giving off the feeling of
          isolation. Despite this, the content of their conversation reflects
          the mass amount of information available through the internet: “more
          movies…”, and overall, lots of data.
        </p>

        <p>
          All these works engage with themes of interconnectedness and the
          excessive amount of information on the web. They invite questions:
          What does it mean to have access to so much data? What are the
          implications of having personal information accessible to others
          online? And how do we visually make sense of this system?
