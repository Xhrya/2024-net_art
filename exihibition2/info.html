        The works that I have chosen to include in this exhibition are "The
        Thing" by Wolfgang Staehle, "Conversation Map" by Warren Sack, "ART DIRT
        IM-PORT" by G.H. Hovagimyan and guests, and ".ping Project" by
        Umstätter, Antya; Meschkat, Steffen; Schmidt, Axel. All play around with
        the idea of the internet bringing people together in a way that creates
        a sense of information overload and an interwoven web of information.
        Most notably seen through "The Conversation Map", which reflects on a
        very large scale, the usage of the internet - and the interconnected web
        and relationships between messages and their results, and the
        overwhelming amount of lines connecting the different conversations are
        seen. This, followed by the ".ping project", further digs deeper into
        the visible structure of the network connection. I find it interesting
        that the interactive map of the World Wide Web, as shown through the
        visual camera in this ".ping" computer program, again shows a series of
        lines (which create a web) that are interconnected in a way that’s hard
        to untangle. The of lines forming the web, once again, highlights the
        interactive nature of the internet, and the mass amount of data it
        contains. Next, I feature two artworks that reflect on how conversations
        and data are added to the web as seen in the first two artworks. "The
        Thing" acted as a means to further the realm of data nets and
        communications. Here, various discussions and conversations could be
        had. If looking at it as a larger picture, these conversations and
        strings contributed to the web as seen in the ".ping", and "Conversation
        Map". The final artwork that I decided to include, "ARTDIRT IM-PORT", is
        an ironic representation of the bundled strings as seen in the other two
        artworks. I found this piece interesting because although the first two
        pieces of artwork showcase an overcrowded ball of information, here,
        through a chat window that shows a two-way conversation between port1
        and port2. Within the confines of their physical spaces, these two are
        lonely, as shown through the various screenshots - covering their bodies
        with a blanket and isolating themselves in front of the computer, or
        lying on the floor with their faces veiled - giving off the feeling of
        isolation. Despite this, the content of their conversation reflects the
        mass amount of information available through the internet: “more
        movies…”, and overall, lots of data. All in all, I feel that these
        artworks tie together the idea of interconnectedness and the complex
        interleaved web of the excessive amount of information on the web. These
        artworks make me delve deeper into the complexity, nature, and
        implications of having a mass amount of data about ourselves on the
        digital web, and how this data ties together into a bigger picture.
